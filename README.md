## Build
*If you are running build first time*, use these commands:
```zsh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```
Then you can build the project from `build/` folder just by running:
```zsh
make
```

## Running tests
Run from `build/`:
```zsh
make test
```
...or:
```zsh
ctest
```

## Auto-formatting
Run from `build/`:
```zsh
make format
```
